# ChatGPT-4O-PWA-Prompts

With obtaining standard and clean pulse signals for subsequent analysis, preprocessing is an important step in Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA). Owing to the complexities of pulse signals as analytical subjects, researchers usually dedicate substantial effort to the selection of preprocessing strategies and methodologies. To assist researchers in expediting the selection of preprocessing strategies for pulse signals, thereby facilitating the expedited identification of more suitable preprocessing methods, this study proposes a customizable method using Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 OMINI (GPT-4O), a large language model (LLM) having superior performances in various domains and tasks, by designing customizable prompts for preprocessing in pulse signals.
